# Super Bowl Data Analysis Project
## The Big Game Means Business
The Super Bowl has evolved beyond a mere sporting event; it's a cultural phenomenon where advertisers invest heavily to captivate the massive audience. However, the effectiveness of these commercials in terms of brand engagement and subsequent financial performance remains a subject of debate. The group has been employed by PyBrands International, a company with a diverse global portfolio ranging from Food and Beverage, Health and Wellness, to luxury Automotive production. The group's proposal aims to investigate the correlation between Super Bowl commercial characteristics, brand engagement metrics, and their impact on stock performance. PyBrands International have tasked the group with guiding the strategic decisions regarding their Super Bowl commercial investment. The group's primary objective is to identify the most effective commercial strategy that will yield maximum growth and revenue for our company. Through comprehensive analysis of Super Bowl commercial data, we aim to uncover meaningful trends that link the type of commercial produced to its viewership metrics, in order to ensure that PyBrands International makes informed decisions in regard to its Super Bowl commercial strategy, thereby maximizing their potential for success and revenue generation.
 
## Objectives
- To determine if there is a correlation between the cost of a Super Bowl commercial that a brand produces and the number of views it receives.
  
- To examine if there is a relationship between the type of brand and the engagement metrics (likes/views) they garner during the Super Bowl.
  
- To assess whether the success of Super Bowl commercials bolsters the future stock performance of the brands involved and offer correlation between tactical roll out due to present and future cost of advertisement.


## Facts by Numbers
Starting out, the group wanted to take a macro to micro approach, focusing on sourcing plenty of meaningful information from multiple data sources to create a big picture before diving in. Moving through the data was at times difficult, working to determine what information would yield the best results, while also not trying to focus on a particular set of data and overlook something meaningful. The group wanted to find information that was transcendent, establishing the content to be impactful, then whittling down the information pipeline to begin the microscopic approach. The massive amount of API information needed at first was also a challenge, with limited API pulls with different sites causing some extra work, but the group pushed through. Once a calculated approach for the data representation was established, the group worked to bring the facts to life, ensuring that PyBrands International would be comfortable making an informed decision based upon the research of the group.

## The Long Road Home
The group coordinated the research for the prohect following the below steps and arrived with a conclusion:

Data Breakdown and Exploration:
Initially, the dataset was analyzed to identify the top-viewed and bottom-viewed Super Bowl commercials.
Despite examining various factors such as YouTube views, likes, and estimated costs, no significant correlations were observed between these metrics.

Analysis of Commercial Types:
To delve deeper, an investigation was conducted to determine if certain types of commercials resonated more with audiences than others.
The frequency of different commercial types was visualized using a pie chart to identify prevalent themes.

Comparison of Top and Bottom Viewed Commercials:
A comparative analysis was performed between the breakdowns of top-viewed and bottom-viewed commercials to identify any notable differences in commercial types.

Average Commercial Types per Industry:
Further analysis was conducted to calculate the average commercial types per industry, providing insights into which types were more frequently viewed across different sectors.
Additionally, the average commercial types per industry were examined based on likes to determine if certain types were more favorably received.

Stock Performance Analysis:
Focusing on the most-viewed and most-liked brand (e.g., Pepsi), a detailed analysis of their stock performance in 2012 and 2013 was conducted.
The relationship between the overall price change of the stock and advertising costs was explored to project potential future advertising expenses.

## Conclusion

While advertising undoubtedly plays a significant role in a company's growth trajectory, it's imperative to recognize that various other factors influence a company's performance in the stock market. While a well-executed advertising campaign can bolster brand visibility and consumer engagement, it's essential to acknowledge the complex interplay of market dynamics, industry trends, macroeconomic factors, and corporate strategies that collectively shape a company's stock performance.
Moreover, advertising trends are inherently dynamic, subject to rapid shifts in consumer preferences, technological advancements, and competitive landscapes. What may resonate with audiences today may not necessarily maintain the same appeal tomorrow. Therefore, while effective advertising strategies can undoubtedly contribute to enhancing a company's advertising performance, a comprehensive approach that considers a myriad of factors is essential for sustained success. 
In essence, while advertising remains a vital component of a company's marketing arsenal, it should be complemented by a holistic understanding of market conditions, consumer behavior, and strategic positioning. By leveraging data-driven insights, staying abreast of evolving trends, and adopting agile marketing practices, companies can optimize their advertising performance and drive sustainable growth in today's dynamic business landscape.
