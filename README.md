# Super Bowl Data Analysis Project
## The Big Game Means Business
The Super Bowl has evolved beyond a mere sporting event; it's a cultural phenomenon where advertisers invest heavily to captivate the massive audience. However, the effectiveness of these commercials in terms of brand engagement and subsequent financial performance remains a subject of debate. The group has been employed by PyBrands International, a company with a diverse global portfolio ranging from Food and Beverage, Health and Wellness, to luxury Automotive production. The group's proposal aims to investigate the correlation between Super Bowl commercial characteristics, brand engagement metrics, and their impact on stock performance. PyBrands International have tasked the group with guiding the strategic decisions regarding their Super Bowl commercial investment. The group's primary objective is to identify the most effective commercial strategy that will yield maximum growth and revenue for our company. Through comprehensive analysis of Super Bowl commercial data, we aim to uncover meaningful trends that link the type of commercial produced to its viewership metrics, in order to ensure that PyBrands International makes informed decisions in regard to its Super Bowl commercial strategy, thereby maximizing their potential for success and revenue generation.
 
## Objectives
·        To determine if there is a correlation between the cost of Super Bowl commercial that a brand produces and the number of views it receives.

·        To examine if there is a relationship between the type of brand and the engagement metrics (likes/views) they garner during the Super Bowl.

·        To assess whether the success of Super Bowl commercials can trigger positive future stock performance of the brands involved and show correlation between present and future cost of advertisement, to better plan a strategic view for timing execution.

## Facts by Numbers
Starting out, the group wanted to take a macro to micro approach, focusing on sourcing plenty of meaningful information from multiple data sources to create a big picture before diving in. Moving through the data was at times difficult, working to determine what information would yield the best results, while also not trying to focus on a particular set of data and overlook something meaningful. The group wanted to find information that was transcendent, establishing the content to be impactful, then whittling down the information pipeline to begin the microscopic approach. The massive amount of API information needed at first was also a challenge, with limited API pulls with different sites causing some extra work, but the group pushed through. Once a calculated approach for the data representation was established, the group worked to bring the facts to life, ensuring that PyBrands International would be comfortable making an informed decision based upon the research of the group.
