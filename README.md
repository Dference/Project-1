# Super Bowl Data Analysis Project
## The Big Game Means Business
The Super Bowl has evolved beyond a mere sporting event; it's a cultural phenomenon where advertisers invest heavily to captivate the massive audience. However, the effectiveness of these commercials in terms of brand engagement and subsequent financial performance, remains a subject of debate. The group has been employed by PyBrands International, a company with a diverse global portfolio ranging from Food and Beverage, Health and Wellness, to luxury Automotive production. The group's proposal aims to investigate the correlation between Super Bowl commercial characteristics, brand engagement metrics, and their impact on stock performance. PyBrands International have tasked the group with guiding the strategic decisions regarding their Super Bowl commercial investment. The group's primary objective is to identify the most effective commercial strategy that will yield maximum growth and revenue for our company. Through comprehensive analysis of Super Bowl commercial data, we aim to uncover meaningful trends that link the type of commercial produced to its viewership metrics, in order to ensure that PyBrands International makes informed decisions in regards to its Super Bowl commercial strategy, thereby maximizing their potential for success and revenue generation.
